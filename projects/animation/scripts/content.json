              "text": "Painting animation is the art of capturing one painting transforming into another through stop-motion technique. Unlike traditional animation where you draw each frame separately, painting animation involves continuously altering a single surface—painting over what you just created, capturing it, then painting again. It's an ephemeral medium where each frame exists only briefly before being transformed into the next."

              "type": "paragraph",
              "text": "I discovered this medium while creating Unleaving, a video game supported by Telefilm Canada. Over three years, I created thousands of paintings and conducted more than 22,000 scans for landscapes and background scenes. But it was a single moment—scanning a floating leaf on glass against a blank background, then watching it drift through the game world—that changed everything. That's when I fell in love with painting animation."

            {
              "type": "paragraph",
              "text": "What draws me to this medium is its capacity for emotional storytelling. Hand-painted frames carry a warmth and humanity that's different from digital animation. There's something about seeing brush strokes, watching paint blend and transform, that creates an intimate connection with viewers. It's not just about making things look beautiful—it's about making people feel."
