# Color Theory and Materials in Painting Animation

## Introduction

Color in painting animation must work both as individual painted frames and as flowing movement. This guide draws from hands-on experience creating the Inception interactive project, working with mentors Mark Boston and Asmaa Al-Issa, and insights from painting animator Carine Khalife.

## Color Theory for Painting Animation

### Limited Palette Approach

**The 2-3 Color Principle:**

From project experience: "Use 2 colors with usually high contrast"

When painting transformation sequences for Inception, reducing the color palette to 5 colors maximum became essential for:

- Maintaining consistency across frames
- Better focus for animation (forces you to be reductive, and therefore more consistent)
- Keeping attention on shape rather than color during transformations

### Color Palette Development

**Research and Inspiration:**

For the Inception project, color palette research included:

- Space telescope images for cosmic scenes
- NASA photography references
- Museum collections (Metropolitan Museum, Guggenheim, Centre Pompidou, National Gallery)
- Carine Khalife's work (specifically "Womb Stories")
- Kim Keever's atmospheric paintings
- "A Child is Born" book imagery
- "Heaven and Earth" book

**December 2024 Color Guidance from Asmaa:**

Key feedback on developing the color palette:

- "The colours are part of the strong effect it has on you, including the bright, soft, clean pink"
- Try pastel colors with less dark added to them
- "More cleaner / innocence/purity of pink"
- Reduce color palette to 5 colors
- Consider whether palette gets warmer or cooler
- "Less flash color - less red/orange"

**Example of Effective Palette:**
"An example of consistent dark colour, with three bright colours that stand out (yellow, magenta, blue) - similar to the painting that resonates with you that uses the dark greens, plus bright pink/yellow/green"

**Reference Inspiration:**
"Light refracting in crystal, reference the brightness of the clean colours - how to move beyond the comfort of using earth tones"

### Color Guidelines from Project Experience

**Asmaa's Guidance on Color Use:**

When working on transformation moments:

- "Use of 2-3 colors while transforming"
- "Focus on shapes"
- "Don't change dark/light it's distracting from shape"
- "Don't use red" (as a main color)

**September 2024 Feedback:**
"The backgrounds are too light in the middle, they need less white and more toning down yet bright in middle"

**February 2024 Feedback:**
Moving away from literal representation to "abstract of colors and shapes. The real thing inspires us but not to represent it exactly like that"

## Color Materials for Painting Animation

### Paint Types Used in the Project

**From Project Documentation:**

**Acrylic:**

- "Use acrylics with materials you will have less than 5 minutes to animate"
- Quick drying time limited animation possibilities
- Tried for early experiments with glass layers

**Water-Based Oil (Water-Mixable Oil):**

- "Water soluble > 15 minutes - half an hour" working time
- Used for many painting animation experiments
- "Tried animation with water based oil painting"

**Traditional Oil:**

- "Oil > 2 hours to work with"
- "Tried animation with oil painting and it gave me a lot of difficulty breathing"
- Health concerns noted during project

**Project Decision (November 2024):**
Milestone achieved: "Choosing water based oil colors"

### Water-Mixable Oil Colors

**Material Notes from December 2024:**
"Oil colour water mixables"

**Working Properties:**

From Carine Khalife Interview (March 2024):

**Question: What is your favorite medium?**
"I have worked with many mediums, but my favorite is oil on glass. It allows me to capture the feeling of strong, strange movement that I like to create. My secret is mixing oil paint with a lot of grease—it's the best way to keep the paint pliable for days."

**Question: Is there a specific type of grease you use to mix with oil?**
"It's just a generic grease. I use half paint and half grease. The smell is actually more bearable than oil by itself or oil mixed with turpentine."

**Why This Matters:**
Carine noted: "I used to have a studio at home, but I know oil can cause headaches and be bad for health, especially when mixed with turpentine. That's why I prefer working with grease."

### Traditional Oil Colors

**Project Experience (November 2024):**

"Tried animation with oil painting and it gave me a lot of difficulty breathing"

This led to choosing water-based oil colors as the primary medium for the project.

**Working Time:**
"Oil color are best, it takes a while to dry, but the least accessible, most difficult to work with in terms of cost, space, fragrance."

### Acrylic Paint

**From Project Notes:**

"Use acrylics with materials you will have less than 5 minutes to animate"

**Project Experience:**

Early experiments in July 2024:

- "I tried painting on through layers with acrylic glass"
- Used for initial glass layer experiments before settling on oil-based paints

November 2024:

- "Tried animation with acrylic painting" (alongside water-based oil and traditional oil tests)

**Working Time Challenge:**
The very short working time (less than 5 minutes) made acrylics difficult for the complex transformation sequences needed for Inception.

## Color Application Techniques

### Glass Layers and Depth

**The Glass Sandwich Technique:**

From project documentation, painting on multiple glass layers creates depth through actual physical space between layers.

**March 2024 Experiment:**
"For capturing you need to think to capture with white or black underneath" - noted when experimenting with the "3d sandwich" technique

**June 2024 Discovery:**
"If we paint on 2 layers there's no major difference will appear whether it was done on photoshop or reality"

This led to exploring more layers for genuine depth perception.
"I work in a dark room. I don't use daylight; you have to have a constant source of light."

**Key Insight:**
When painting on glass with light from beneath, the thickness of paint application affects darkness independently of the color used. This is unique to transparent surface animation.

---

**Color Considerations:**

- Using "darker to lighter" progression through layers
- The challenge: "What is the point of using the glass layers? If you don't see it in real life? You need to use depth like parallax"

### Color and Light Interaction

**From Carine Khalife Interview:**

**Question: What do you use for light source during painting animation?**

"I use a lightbox that comes from beneath. The more paint there is, the darker it is. Color and darkness are different. I can paint bright yellow, but the more I add, it can turn darker. I love how you can see the brush strokes through the light."

**Question: Do you come across reflection during capturing?**

## Color for Emotional Storytelling

### Carine Khalife's Approach to Feeling Over Representation

**From Interview (March 2024):**

**On finding the right approach:**
"It's more a feeling I'm looking for rather than a reference or a book. I want to understand how to make people feel in order to capture it. It's not exactly what it is, but rather a feeling. What people feel when they look at the frame — that's the abstraction of it."

**On the creative process:**
"You have to be in a certain mood or feeling before you paint. I read a little, then I go to the studio. It's always difficult to get into the feeling. If it doesn't work, I go back and do it again. I don't have a smooth process. It's always difficult. I know it takes time, but when I know what feeling to capture, it becomes easier."

**On her work "Womb Stories":**
"There was a collection of short videos telling a story of 3 to 4 seconds each, it had to be very powerful."

### Project-Specific Color Emotions

**Inception Project Theme:**
The cosmic/microscopic connection - "Relationship between the small and the big, like the atom and the cosmos"

**Color Choices for Scenes:**

- Pinks and soft colors for womb-like nurturing scenes (inspired by Khalife's womb work)
- Cosmic blues and purples for space/universe sequences
- Moving between "cosmic and our smaller aspect" through color transitions

### Moving Beyond Comfort Zones

**Asmaa's Guidance (December 2024):**

"Sura to push herself in the direction of light, moving away from color palette that's comfortable with, the image that speaks to you"

Specific direction:

- "More cleaner / innocence/purity of pink"
- "Try pastel colors // less dark added to them"
- "Less flash color - less red/orange"
- "Light refracting in crystal, reference the brightness of the clean colours"
- "How to move beyond the comfort of using earth tones"

**Challenge:**
The project required moving away from comfortable earth tones toward brighter, cleaner cosmic colors that felt less familiar but more true to the vision.

### Color in Transformation Sequences

**February 2025 Guidance from Asmaa:**

Key principles for transformation moments:

- "Use of 2-3 colors while transforming"
- "Focus on shapes"
- "Don't change dark/light it's distracting from shape"
- "Don't use red"

**Philosophy:**
"Moving away from the real thing, abstract of colors and shapes. The real thing inspires us but not to represent it exactly like that"

**December 2024 Note:**
"Choosing 2 colors, or 2 shades of color in transformation"

The approach emphasized letting shape and movement carry the transformation, with color remaining consistent to avoid distraction.

## Practical Color Management

### Consistency Across Frames

**From Project Practice:**

**May 2024 Recommendation:**
"Identify main key art. Keep the color palette and inspiration visible while you paint. Make a color palette."

**May 30, 2024:**
"Organize thoughts. Having a focused point of color and inspirations. Collected all key images under KEY REFERENCES, also painted color palette"

**What Was Documented:**

- Physical painted color palette swatches
- Collection of key reference images in one location
- Keeping inspiration visible during painting sessions

### Color Materials Tried

**December 2024:**
"Sura bought colors" (after finalizing palette decisions)

**February 2024:**
Experimented with different color approaches:

- "Trying color by itself wouldn't work, I had to add a liquid to make it last, then spray it"
- "Next time I will try to use less color and more grey then just use arbitrary colors"

---

## Recommendations from Project Experience

### Starting Palette Approach

**From Asmaa's December 2024 Guidance:**

"Reduce color palette to 5"

The recommendation was to work with:

- A limited set of 5 colors maximum
- Consider the palette's temperature (whether it gets warmer or cooler)
- Use consistent dark color with 3 bright colors that stand out (example given: yellow, magenta, blue with dark greens, or bright pink/yellow/green)

### Choosing Your Medium

**Project Timeline:**

**November 2024 - Milestone:**
"Choosing water based oil colors" - final decision after testing multiple mediums

**Testing Process (November 2024):**

- Tried water animation
- Tried animation with acrylic painting
- Tried animation with water based oil painting
- Tried animation with oil painting (caused breathing difficulties)

**Conclusion:**
Water-based oil colors provided the best balance of workability and health safety for the home studio environment.

## Key Insights from the Inception Project

### What Worked

From documented project notes:

**Color Approach:**
✓ Limited palette (2-3 colors for transformations, 5 maximum overall)
✓ High contrast combinations
✓ Consistent dark/light values during transformation sequences
✓ Keeping color palette and inspiration visible while painting
✓ Physical painted color swatches as reference

**Materials:**
✓ Water-mixable oils provided workable time (15-30 minutes to 2 hours)
✓ Choosing materials before committing to full production

**Process:**
✓ Collecting key reference images in one location
✓ Testing multiple approaches before settling on final technique

### Challenges Encountered

**Material Issues:**

- Traditional oil caused breathing difficulties in home studio
- Acrylics dried too quickly (less than 5 minutes)
- Need for proper ventilation when working with oils

**Color Decisions:**

- Backgrounds initially too light in the middle
- Challenge of moving away from comfortable earth tones to cosmic brightness
- Learning when color changes were distracting from shape transformations

### The Philosophy

**From Carine Khalife:**

"Perfection isn't interesting. It takes too much time, and at the end it may not capture the feelings."

**On surrender vs. control:**
"You have a lot of expectations of yourself (pointing very high), but you can meet it in the middle (pointing to half of the distance) whenever you're ready. You may never reach the top or the highest expectations, but who needs perfection? But when you surrender, you realize that's the best place, because it serves the feelings you want to capture."

## Conclusion

Color in painting animation serves both technical and emotional purposes. Through the Inception project, the key learnings were:

1. **Limit your palette** - Working with 2-3 colors during transformations and 5 maximum overall helps maintain consistency and focus
2. **Choose materials thoughtfully** - Water-based oils provided the best balance of workability and safety for home studio work
3. **Prioritize feeling over perfection** - The emotional impact matters more than technical accuracy
4. **Keep references visible** - Physical color swatches and inspiration images help maintain consistency
5. **Test before committing** - Experimenting with different materials and approaches saves time in the long run

As Carine Khalife shared: "It's the feeling you're looking for, not the exact representation."
